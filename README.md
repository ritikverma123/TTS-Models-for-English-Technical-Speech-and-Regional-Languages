 Objective:
 The purpose of this assignment is to fine-tune two text-to-speech (TTS) models. One model will
 be optimized to handle technical jargon commonly used in English technical interviews, such as
 "API," "CUDA," and "TTS." The other model will be fine-tuned for a regional language of your
 choice. You will also explore ways to optimize the model for fast inference, and investigate
 techniques such as quantization to reduce model size without compromising performance.
 Assignment Breakdown:
 Task 1: Fine-tuning TTS for English with a Focus on Technical Vocabulary
 Steps:
 1. Model Selection:
 ○ Use Coqui TTS or SpeechT5 as your base model for English fine-tuning. These
 models are flexible and have excellent multi-speaker capabilities.
 2. Dataset Collection:
 ○ Create or source a dataset that includes technical terms frequently used in
 interviews, such as "API," "CUDA," "TTS," "OAuth," "REST," etc. Ensure that the
 dataset includes both general English sentences and technical terms. You
 can create this dataset by synthesizing interview transcripts or pulling sentences
 from technical blogs.
 3. Fine-tuning:
○ Fine-tune the TTS model to improve pronunciation of these technical terms.
 Focus on modifying the phonetic representation to ensure accurate pronunciation
 of abbreviations and acronyms.
 ○ Adjust hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size to prevent overfitting
 while achieving good pronunciation quality on technical words.
 4. Evaluation:
 ○ Test the model on a set of technical interview questions, ensuring that it can
 pronounce terms like "API" and "CUDA" accurately.
 ○ Use both objective metrics such as Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and
 subjective evaluations from native English speakers familiar with technical
 terms. You may also want to consider pronunciation accuracy (e.g., comparing
 phoneme representations).
 Benchmarks:
 ● Compare your fine-tuned model to pre-trained models like Mozilla TTS or Coqui TTS on
 technical terms.
 ● Evaluate performance based on pronunciation of technical terms, MOS scores, and
 model inference speed.
 Deliverable: Submit a report on the model's performance with logs, dataset
 description, and evaluation results. Include the technical terms list and their correct
 pronunciation output from your fine-tuned model.
 Task 2: Fine-tuning TTS for a Regional Language
 Steps:
 1. Model Selection:
 ○ Use Coqui TTS, SpeechT5, or Bark as your base model, depending on the
 regional language and available dataset. Coqui TTS and SpeechT5 support
 multi-language TTS and can be fine-tuned easily.
 2. Dataset Collection:
 ○ Source or create a dataset for your selected regional language. You can use
 datasets like VoxPopuli or CommonVoice, or record your own data. Ensure that
 the dataset contains natural language sentences and covers a wide range of
 phonemes.
 3. Fine-tuning:
 ○ Fine-tune the model to synthesize high-quality speech in the chosen regional
 language. Adjust the pronunciation, prosody, and stress patterns according to the
 phonological rules of the language.
 ○ Ensure that your dataset has sufficient speaker diversity (if possible) to prevent
 overfitting to a specific speaker's voice.
4. Evaluation:
 ○ Evaluate the model on naturalness and intelligibility using subjective
 evaluation from native speakers of the regional language.
 ○ Measure MOS scores for overall quality, and compare against available
 pre-trained models (if any).
 Benchmarks:
 ● Compare the regional TTS model against any pre-existing models in the same language
 (if available).
 ● Evaluate using both objective metrics (e.g., MOS, inference time) and subjective
 evaluations from native speakers.
 Deliverable: Submit a detailed report, including training logs, dataset description,
 and performance evaluation. Provide audio samples from both the pre-trained and
 fine-tuned models for comparison.
 Bonus Task (Optional): Fast Inference Optimization
 Steps:
 1. Model Quantization:
 ○ Explore quantization techniques (such as Post-Training Quantization or
 Quantization-Aware Training) to reduce model size and increase inference
 speed. Use frameworks like TensorFlow Lite or PyTorch's quantization libraries.
 2. Fast Inference:
 ○ Implement techniques like pruning or distillation to reduce inference time while
 maintaining high-quality output.
 ○ Test the optimized model on a variety of devices (e.g., CPU, GPU, edge devices)
 and record inference time improvements.
 3. Evaluation:
 ○ Measure the trade-off between model size and audio quality (MOS).
 ○ Compareinference speeds on different hardware setups and document results.
 Benchmarks:
 ● Compareinference times before and after quantization or pruning.
 ● Ensure that the quality of synthesized speech remains acceptable by evaluating MOS
 scores pre- and post-quantization.
 Deliverable: Submit a detailed report on the techniques used for optimization,
 including the final model size, inference time, and quality evaluation results.
